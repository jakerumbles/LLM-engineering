      "- A high-level overview of Drosera and its core components.\n",
      "Trappers\n",
      "- Developers that create Traps. Traps are smart contracts responsible for gathering on-chain data and performing analysis over the collected data. Protocols can use Traps to monitor their on-chain state and signal the execution of an on-chain response function.\n",
      "Operators\n",
      "- Decentralized nodes that are responsible for executing Traps and performing on-chain response actions. Operators can opt into a Trap to gain permission to execute it and earn rewards.\n",
      "Seed Nodes\n",
      "- Nodes that are responsible for hosting Traps and bootstrapping Operators into a decentralized network.\n",
      "What is Drosera?\n",
      "Drosera is a passionate team of developers and researchers who are dedicated to building trustless and decentralized infrastructure for detecting exploits and mitigating financial loss. Drosera is an automation protocol that simplifies the process of creating monitoring systems for decentralized applications. It provides a framework for creating and executing automated responses to events on the Ethereum network, enabling developers to create more robust and secure applications.\n",
      "Born out of the need for a more robust security systems for DeFi protocols, Drosera is designed to be native to the Ethereum ecosystem with a strong foundation that can be built upon. Simplicity and developer friendliness were paramount in the design of Drosera, ensuring that its straightforward approach will allow for a wide range of use cases for off-chain monitoring and on-chain responses.\n",
      "As Drosera continues to evolve, we remain committed to providing a secure and user-friendly solution to the DeFi community. Our goal is to empower developers and users alike, fostering a more secure and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n",
      "How Does Drosera Work?\n",
      "Traps\n",
      "Traps are a set of smart contracts that define the conditions for detecting invariants and performing on-chain responses. Traps have an on-chain and off-chain component that are described below:\n",
      "Trap\n",
      "- An off-chain smart contract that performs data collection and analysis to signal the execution of an on-chain response function.\n",
      "Trap Config\n",
      "- An on-chain smart contract that configures the trap and defines the on-chain response callback function. Example: \"pause(uint256)\" , \"react(address)\", etc.\n",
      "The Trap Config holds a hash of the Trap contract and the address of the on-chain response function. It is used to help coordinate the execution of the Trap and the on-chain response function with Operators as well as holding them accountable for doing so.\n",
      "Info\n",
      "The term analysis here is used to describe\n",
      "analysis of on-chain state\n",
      "and does not mean smart contract code analysis with tools like Slither, etc. A trap is collecting state data every block and analyzing the state data to make a decision if the logical criteria have been met or not to trigger the execution of an on-chain response function.\n",
      "Operators\n",
      "Operators are crucial players in Drosera, consisting of organizations and solo stakers who run the Drosera Operator Client software to help maintain and protect the DeFi ecosystem. These dedicated individuals are responsible for executing Traps and performing on-chain response actions, ensuring the security and stability of the network.\n",
      "To execute a Trap, an Operator must first gain permission by opting into the specific Trap. Once opted in, the Operator gains access to the off-chain Trap and the current peers in the network. This allows them to actively participate in monitoring and evaluating every new block based on the conditions set by the Trap.\n",
      "In the event that the conditions of a Trap are met, the Operator will promptly execute the on-chain response function. This swift action helps to mitigate potential threats and exploits.\n",
      "Seed Nodes\n",
      "Seed Nodes are at the core of the Drosera network, providing the infrastructure needed to host Traps and bootstrap Operators into a decentralized network. These nodes are responsible for hosting the Trap bytecode and providing it to Operators when they opt into a Trap.\n",
      "Only trusted Seed Nodes should be used to ensure the integrity of the Trap bytecode. Trusted Seed Nodes are listed in the\n",

This site contains documentation for:\\nLitepaper\\n- A high-level overview of Drosera and its core components.\\nTrappers\\n- Developers that create Traps. Traps are smart contracts responsible for gathering on-chain data and performing analysis over the collected data. Protocols can use Traps to monitor their on-chain state and signal the execution of an on-chain response function.\\nOperators\\n- Decentralized nodes that are responsible for executing Traps and performing on-chain response actions. Operators can opt into a Trap to gain permission to execute it and earn rewards.\\nSeed Nodes\\n- Nodes that are responsible for hosting Traps and bootstrapping Operators into a decentralized network.\\nWhat is Drosera?\\nDrosera is a passionate team of developers and researchers who are dedicated to building trustless and decentralized infrastructure for detecting exploits and mitigating financial loss. Drosera is an automation protocol that simplifies the process of creating monitoring systems for decentralized applications. It provides a framework for creating and executing automated responses to events on the Ethereum network, enabling developers to create more robust and secure applications.\\nBorn out of the need for a more robust security systems for DeFi protocols, Drosera is designed to be native to the Ethereum ecosystem with a strong foundation that can be built upon. Simplicity and developer friendliness were paramount in the design of Drosera, ensuring that its straightforward approach will allow for a wide range of use cases for off-chain monitoring and on-chain responses.\\nAs Drosera continues to evolve, we remain committed to providing a secure and user-friendly solution to the DeFi community. Our goal is to empower developers and users alike, fostering a more secure and robust DeFi ecosystem.\\nHow Does Drosera Work?\\nTraps\\nTraps are a set of smart contracts that define the conditions for detecting invariants and performing on-chain responses. Traps have an on-chain and off-chain component that are described below:\\nTrap\\n- An off-chain smart contract that performs data collection and analysis to signal the execution of an on-chain response function.\\nTrap Config\\n- An on-chain smart contract that configures the trap and defines the on-chain response callback function. Example: \"pause(uint256)\" , \"react(address)\", etc.\\nThe Trap Config holds a hash of the Trap contract and the address of the on-chain response function. It is used to help coordinate the execution of the Trap and the on-chain response function with Operators as well as holding them accountable for doing so.\\nInfo\\nThe term analysis here is used to describe\\nanalysis of on-chain state\\nand does not mean smart contract code analysis with tools like Slither, etc. A trap is collecting state data every block and analyzing the state data to make a decision if the logical criteria have been met or not to trigger the execution of an on-chain response function.\\nOperators\\nOperators are crucial players in Drosera, consisting of organizations and solo stakers who run the Drosera Operator Client software to help maintain and protect the DeFi ecosystem. These dedicated individuals are responsible for executing Traps and performing on-chain response actions, ensuring the security and stability of the network.\\nTo execute a Trap, an Operator must first gain permission by opting into the specific Trap. Once opted in, the Operator gains access to the off-chain Trap and the current peers in the network. This allows them to actively participate in monitoring and evaluating every new block based on the conditions set by the Trap.\\nIn the event that the conditions of a Trap are met, the Operator will promptly execute the on-chain response function. This swift action helps to mitigate potential threats and exploits.\\nSeed Nodes\\nSeed Nodes are at the core of the Drosera network, providing the infrastructure needed to host Traps and bootstrap Operators into a decentralized network. These nodes are responsible for hosting the Trap bytecode and providing it to Operators when they opt into a Trap.\\nOnly trusted Seed Nodes should be used to ensure the integrity of the Trap bytecode. Trusted Seed Nodes are listed in the\\ndeployments\\nsection of the Drosera documentation.\\nHigh Level Architecture\\nLearn More\\nThe Drosera team publishes articles on X. You can find them\\nhere\\n.

       "\n",
       "DeFi is a wild west, and if your monitoring systems are outdated, you’re begging for trouble. Drosera emerged from the chaos, born out of the need for a **robust security framework** that can handle the heat of today’s financial landscape. We exist to empower developers and users to **detect exploits** and **mitigate financial losses**, all while simplifying how decentralized applications can react to events in real-time.\n",

       "## **High-Level Technical Design 🛠️**\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Traps - The Heart of Drosera**\n",
       "Traps are where the magic happens. They are smart contracts tasked with gathering on-chain data and executing automated responses. Think of them as your watchdogs in the Ethereum jungle—monitoring like a hawk, reacting faster than your enemies can strike. \n",
       "\n",
       "- **On-chain and off-chain components:** Deliver timely responses to suit real-world demands.\n",
       "- **Asynchronous composability:** This ensures flawless interactions between off-chain computation and on-chain state—yup, no hiccups.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Operators**\n",
       "Drosera operators are not just users; they are the **guardians** of the network. The folks running these nodes use our powerful client software to monitor conditions and act as the first line of defense against threats. If you thought being an operator was just for tech nerds, think again. Only the truly elite will thrive.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Seed Nodes**\n",
       "These bad boys host the Trap bytecode and help onboard operators into our decentralized network. But beware—only use trusted Seed Nodes, or you’ll risk compromising the integrity of your operations.\n",

       "\n",
       "Here are just a few ways you can harness the og strength of Drosera:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Automated Liquidation Responses:** Never let collateralization ratios drop the ball again.\n",
       "- **Data Integrity Checks:** Keep your oracles in check. Catch fraud before it happens!\n",
       "- **Governance Mechanisms:** Safeguard against malicious actors trying to manipulate votes. You think you can just roll up and take over? Not on Drosera’s watch.\n",
       "\n",
       "And that’s just scratching the surface. If you find a problem within DeFi, there's a high chance Drosera can tackle it.\n",

       "\n",
       "## **Development Flow: Get Started Fast 🚀**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Install the Drosera CLI:** Jump in quickly by executing this command:\n",
       "   bash\n",
       "   curl -L https://app.drosera.io/install | bash\n",
       "   \n",
       "2. **Create your Trap:** Use the provided templates and customize them according to your own killer idea.\n",
       "3. **Run your Operator:** Opt into your chosen Trap and start executing commands that will leave the competition trembling.\n",
       "\n",
       "With simple engagement strategies and a mighty backend, your path to domination is paved.\n",
